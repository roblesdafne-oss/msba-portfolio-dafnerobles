\f0\fs32 What did you personally contribute to the most?\
\
I think my biggest contribution was on this project was the variables analysis including some feature engineering and the preprocessing to create them. And afterwards running linear regression analysis, XGBoost and Random Forest models to compare results with my team mates. \

\f0\fs32 What is one decision or approach you personally advocated for and why?\
\
I highly advocated to bundle the services and the add on but to leave internet service as an independent variable as there were many other variables related to it. \
\
## What are one or two lessons learned from the case competition, and what would you add on or improve in your case if you had more time?\
\
I would definitely spend more time on the segmentation side using K means I definitely did not get a chance to dive into it and I believed it added a lot of value}
